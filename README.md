# FreeOnEpicBot
A bot that will notify you when there are new games on steam

## Commands:
- '/freegame' - show the current free game

No other commands, the bot notifies when new games become free automatically

## Setting up: 
Clone the repo => Change bot token and user id in main file, and either host locally or deploy to heroku

## Marks:
- The code can be better, just got busy and no time for refactoring/improvements, will be happy for feedback!
